# tft-helper

## Description

TFT Helper is a web-app designed to help players learn personal trends. Instead of looking at the performance of comps and augments, it will instead look at the personal performance of comps, champs and augments. 

It will integrate with Riot Games' API to look at the player's games on the current patch and current set(current set but non-current patch games will have less weight) to identify strong and weak points of the player's style (i.e: low-cost reroll vs fast 8/9 comps)

Players will have a summary of their most recent(patchwide?) games and stats for each one. (Average placement for augment, champs, traits)

Players will also be able to narrow down/filter results to get a deeper understanding of the stats.

## Bonus Features

If the API allows, we will check snapshots for openers played each game so players can see what did and didn't work.
